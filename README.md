# Teaching examples

------------------

This repository contains code snippets and vignettes that I've used as teaching examples over a number of different courses. The repository is not particularly cohesive, it's intended to capture one-off teaching examples that I can pick and choose from and share on an ad hoc basis. 

**stats/ repository:**

- **power-simulation**: use simulation to estimate power across a range of effect sizes and sample sizes
