## Data collection details 
# "The Trust in Digital Health project was conducted by the Centre for Social Research in Health, 
# UNSW Sydney in collaboration with community organisations to assess views of digital health systems 
# in Australia, particularly among communities affected by bloodborne viruses and sexually transmissible 
# infections. We conducted a national, online survey of Australians' attitudes to digital health in 
# April–June 2020. The sample (N=2,240) was recruited from the general population and four priority 
# populations affected by HIV and other sexually transmissible infections: gay and bisexual men, 
# people living with HIV, sex workers, and trans and gender-diverse people. The deidentified dataset 
# and syntax provided here were used for an analysis of factors associated with greater knowledge of My 
# Health Record and the likelihood of opting out of the system. My Health Record is Australia's national, 
# digital, personal health record system."

## From the peer-reviewed publication
## "Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify independent associations with each outcome 
## (knowledge of My Health Record and opting out or deleting the record). Covariates included demographic details, 
## socioeconomic status, having chronic health conditions, self-reported health status [39], 
## receiving mental health care, and membership of the targeted priority populations.
