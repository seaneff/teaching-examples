"The Trust in Digital Health project was conducted by the Centre for Social Research in Health, UNSW Sydney in collaboration with community organisations to assess views of digital health systems in Australia, particularly among communities affected by bloodborne viruses and sexually transmissible infections. We conducted a national, online survey of Australians' attitudes to digital health in Aprilâ€“June 2020. The sample (N=2,240) was recruited from the general population and four priority populations affected by HIV and other sexually transmissible infections: gay and bisexual men, people living with HIV, sex workers, and trans and gender-diverse people. The deidentified dataset and syntax provided here were used for an analysis of factors associated with greater knowledge of My Health Record and the likelihood of opting out of the system. My Health Record is Australia's national, digital, personal health record system."
